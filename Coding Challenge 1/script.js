Variables
1. Write a program that declares two variables, one with your name and 
one with a number value of your age. Concatenate the two variables and 
output the result to the console.

2. Repeat the coding task 2 of output by putting these strings in variables 
and then outputting variables.

BMI 
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using 
the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
Note - The syntax for exponentiation is two asterisks in a row ( ** )
Your Tasks
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables 
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula 
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark 
has a higher BMI than John.
